# Sentiment Analysis - Score Checker API based on SentenceTransformers

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/yourusername/sentiment-analysis)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-v3.11-blue)


## Overview

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using machine learning. It analyzes text input and classifies it as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The project uses the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a pre-trained model to achieve this classification.

The project is based on the [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) library, which enables the extraction of semantic embeddings from text. These embeddings are used to improve sentiment analysis accuracy.

## Features

- Sentiment classification for text input
- NLP techniques and machine learning model
- Utilizes Sentence Transformers for semantic embeddings

## Requirements

- Python 3.11.1 or higher
